Quarter past nine the demo for the second sprint started and we presented our progress. We presented our only finished story, 
which was to implement tabs. We also presented our nearly finished stories, alarm for departure, alarm for destination and combine trips.
Most of the question were suggestions about features to implement. 

You can find our presentation [here!](https://team-eight.github.io/assets/pdf/Demo-2.pdf)
