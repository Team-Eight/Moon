Stockholm Commute is a derivate of the STHLM Traveling app, where our goal is to add some much needed functionality for customizing your travels
but also to add some extra quality of life to make the app more sleek.

## Planned features
* Combining multiple travels
* Additional alarms for departure and disembarking
* Greater set of parameters to customizing journeys
* A refreshed Graphical Interface

## Preview

Coming soon!
